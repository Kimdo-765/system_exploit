Format String Bug

1. Original FSB
	1. Conditions
		a. printf(data) : fprintf, printf, sprintf, snprintf, vfprintf, vprintf, vsprintf, syslog
		b. data is located at stack (local variables)
	2. Exploit
		a. Check offset from $esp at print_function(input) :
			1. In local machine or binary givem , we can use GDB or something
			2. In remote, we can input <AAAA + "%x" * n> and check offset where AAAA printed
		b. There are 3 considerations : offset, number of format, malicious value
		c. offset : 
			1. if offset == 0, target address is located at offset + number_of_format - 1, we fill 0 ~ offset + number_of_format - 2 with dummy
			2. if offset > 0, target address is located at offset or offset + dummy
		d. number of format : 
			1. In gerneral, we need 2 format, one for setting malicious value, the other for %n
		e. malicious value :
			1. malicious value = 8|4(in 32bit) * n(dummy + target address) + written_bytes_by_format
			2. so, written_bytes_by_format = malicious value - 8 * n
		f. payload = DUMMY + target_address + "%NUMBERx" + "%n" : we write malicious value at target address
	3. Value
		a. Write arbitary value at arbitary address!!!
